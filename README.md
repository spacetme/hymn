Carols in Harmony
=================

This year, at [Sapan Luang Church](http://www.sapanluang.org/),
our group will go caroling as a [SATB choir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATB),
composed of soprano, alto, tenor and bass voices.
Each voice have to sing different notes,
and practicing them takes a lot of time.

This tool is created to help with rehearsal.
